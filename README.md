# ü§ù Orangery Matchmaker

Welcome to Orangery Matchmaker! It's a Discord bot dedicated to helping collaborators find each other and team up on projects. Our bot allows users to create profiles, specify their skills, and join or create lobbies for collaborative projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Profile Management**: Create and manage your profiles with ease using the `/profile` command. Set up your call name, bio, and available jobs.
- **Job Management**: Add or remove jobs to your profile using the `/setjobs` and `/removejob` commands, respectively. We provide autocomplete functionality to help you find existing jobs in the server.
- **Lobby Management**: Create a lobby for your projects with the `/createlobby` command. Manage your lobbies with commands like `/viewlobbystatus`, `/lobbyinfo`, `/kickfromlobby`, `/blockuser`, `/unblockuser`, and `/announce`.
- **Availability Status**: Let others know if you're available for projects using the `/available` command.
- **Joining Lobbies**: Join a lobby if there are available slots and you have the required skills using the `/joinlobby` command.
- **Activity Tracking**: We track user activity and provide a leaderboard of the most active users in the server.
